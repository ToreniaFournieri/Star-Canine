Star Canine :TEXT-BASED ROGUELIKE
SPACE EXPEDITION SPECIFICATION v0.1.0 (CODING-READY)

⸻

	1.	GAME OVERVIEW

This is a terminal-based, deterministic, text-only roguelike spaceship game.
	•	No randomness in combat
	•	No graphics
	•	No real-time input during battle
	•	Designed to be playable and solvable by LLMs
	•	Inspired by Slay the Spire, but simpler

Player progresses through fixed stages, fighting enemies, managing hull HP and ammo, and upgrading ship equipment.

⸻

	2.	CORE CONCEPTS

	•	The player controls ONE ship
	•	Battles are 1 vs 1
	•	Damage persists between battles (hull only)
	•	Ammo is a limited resource
	•	Strategy is about:
	•	Equipment selection
	•	Ammo usage
	•	Preventing enemy attacks by killing first

⸻

	3.	PLAYER SHIP (BASE STATS)

Initial player ship:
	•	Hull HP: 200
	•	Ammo: 4
	•	Equipment slots: 6

Ammo persists between battles and is NOT fully restored automatically.

⸻

	4.	EQUIPMENT SYSTEM

4.1 Inventory vs Slots
	•	Inventory: all equipment the player owns
	•	Slots: up to 6 equipped items
	•	ONLY equipped items affect combat
	•	Equipment can be freely swapped between battles

At the start of each battle, player:
	•	Sees full equipment list

	6.	COMBAT STRUCTURE

6.1 Turn Order

⸻

6.2 Attack Resolution Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)

On EACH turn:
